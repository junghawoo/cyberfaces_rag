## Why is Spatial Clustering Important?

Spatial clustering is a core method in geospatial analysis for identifying how
points, people, places, or events are distributed across space. Instead of treating
data as isolated observations, clustering helps us detect **patterns**, revealing
where concentrations or groupings occur — and just as importantly, where they do not.

Clustering allows us to transform large sets of point data into meaningful spatial
insights that can guide research, decision-making, and planning.

### What Spatial Clustering Helps Us Understand

* Where events or features form geographic **hotspots**
* How points group based on proximity or similarity
* Regions of high vs. low density
* Patterns of distribution — clustered, dispersed, or random?
* Spatial relationships in social, environmental, or urban data
* Location-based trends that maps alone may not reveal

### Why Analysts Use Spatial Clustering

- Reduces **complex spatial datasets** into interpretable groups  
- Helps detect clusters in public health (disease outbreaks), crime, ecology, and more  
- Identifies **emerging hotspots** for management or intervention  
- Useful for **urban planning, environmental monitoring, and archaeology**  
- Works well as a first step for further spatial statistics (PySAL, regression, AI)  
- Enables classification, prediction, and pattern recognition in large datasets  

### Clustering at a Glance

| Method | Strength | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| K-Means | Simple, fast | Well-separated, circular clusters |
| Hierarchical | Dendrogram visualization | Multi-scale grouping, unknown k values |
| DBSCAN | Finds irregular shapes + noise | Spatial hotspots and natural patterns |

Spatial clustering is often the **first analytical step** when exploring point
distribution. It moves the analysis beyond visual mapping — showing not only where
points are located, but how spatial processes shape them.


## Introduction

Spatial clustering is a core method used in geography, archaeology, ecology, and
urban studies. It helps identify *patterns* in the spatial distribution of points—such
as hotspots of crime, clusters of archaeological artifacts, or regions with similar
environmental characteristics.

This beginner tutorial walks you through the fundamentals of spatial clustering
using a simple dataset of geographic coordinates. The workflow is entirely in
Python, following the structure used in your uploaded notebook.

We will cover:

- Loading and exploring point data  
- Preparing coordinates for clustering  
- Running three clustering algorithms  
- Visualizing the results  

All examples use standard Python libraries:  
`pandas`, `geopandas`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, and `scipy`.

Learners may need extra time understanding the differences between clustering
algorithms. Consider pausing after each method and showing multiple visualizations.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## 1. Loading Spatial Point Data

Spatial clustering typically starts with a set of point locations. A minimal example:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("points.csv")   # contains lon, lat
df.head()
```

Visualize the raw points:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(df.lon, df.lat, s=10)
plt.title("Raw Spatial Points")
plt.xlabel("Longitude")
plt.ylabel("Latitude")
plt.show()
```

This simple scatterplot helps identify whether your data already looks clustered.


## 2. K-Means Clustering

K-Means is the simplest clustering algorithm.
It works best when:

- You know the number of clusters you want

- Clusters are roughly circular

- Points are evenly distributed

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

coords = df[['lon', 'lat']]
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=42)
df['kmeans_label'] = kmeans.fit_predict(coords)
```

Visualize results:

```python
plt.scatter(df.lon, df.lat, c=df.kmeans_label, cmap='tab10')
plt.title("K-Means Clustering")
plt.show()
```

## 3. Hierarchical Clustering


Hierarchical clustering builds clusters step-by-step.
It is useful when:

- You want a dendrogram

- You don’t know the number of clusters beforehand

- Clusters may have irregular shapes

Example:


```python
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering

agg = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=4)
df['hier_label'] = agg.fit_predict(coords)
```

Plot:

```python
plt.scatter(df.lon, df.lat, c=df.hier_label, cmap='viridis')
plt.title("Hierarchical Clustering")
plt.show()
```


## 4. DBSCAN: Density-Based Clustering

DBSCAN is ideal for spatial datasets because:

- It finds clusters of any shape

- It identifies noise points

- It does not require the number of clusters in advance

Example:


```python
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
import numpy as np

epsilon = 0.01   # distance threshold
db = DBSCAN(eps=epsilon, min_samples=5).fit(coords)

df['dbscan_label'] = db.labels_

```

Points labeled `-1` are noise (outliers).

Plot:
```python
plt.scatter(df.lon, df.lat, c=df.dbscan_label, cmap='Accent')
plt.title("DBSCAN Spatial Clusters")
plt.show()
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

Challenge 1: Exploring Your Own Dataset

Using the examples above:

1. Load your own set of spatial coordinates

2. Apply K-Means and DBSCAN

3. Compare the results

Which method performs better, and why?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

Example Interpretation

* K-Means finds evenly divided clusters

* DBSCAN finds natural geographic groups and labels outliers

* For irregular spatial patterns, DBSCAN usually performs better

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


Challenge 2: Adjusting DBSCAN Sensitivity

Try changing the `eps` parameter:

```python
DBSCAN(eps=500, min_samples=5) # eps is in meters
DBSCAN(eps=1000,  min_samples=5)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

Larger `eps` creates larger clusters.
Smaller `eps` creates more clusters and more noise points.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Math

DBSCAN uses density to define clusters. Its key idea:

A point belongs to a cluster if it has at least `min_samples` neighbors within a
distance `ε`:

`$\text{density} = \frac{\text{neighbors}}{\pi \varepsilon^2}$`

Higher density regions form clusters; low density points become noise.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

* Spatial clustering groups geographic points into meaningful patterns

* K-Means is simple but assumes circular clusters

* Hierarchical clustering builds clusters step-wise

* DBSCAN is best for irregular shapes and detecting noise

* Always visualize your clusters to interpret them correctly
